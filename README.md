# Candidate Search

An command-line tool to find job candidates on GitHub.

## Installation

### Requirements

PHP â‰¥ 7.2

## Usage

Here's how to search for job candidates in a given city with PHP as their primary language (based on the GitHub repositories they authored).
```
./candidate search language:PHP location:Bucharest
```

## About

This quick and dirty-ish script is quite opinionated, and it's what I used during my search to recruit software engineers at my company.

It's unlikely I will actively pursue this project further, but I made sure that search parameters could be adapted to support more tailored searches ready out of the box.

Feel free to fork it from here and adapt it to your own needs.
